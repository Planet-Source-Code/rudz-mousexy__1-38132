 - So why waste any time on this feeble little util ?
  Programs like Photoshop have such a thing build in to it (and i use it).
  So I threw together this one to have when needed (or just for the fun of it :)



 - The MouseXY.ini

	Back=
		Yup, this little baby is kinda skinable, just make you'r own background and
		enter the filename here
		(note: if file is located other than application path, the full path must be specified)
		Supports : Bmp, Gif, Jpg
		ex: C:\MyBack.jpg

	Front=
		Font color in RGB seperated by a ":" (without the ")

	Font=
		Set the font name for the font you wish to use.
		ex: Ariel

	Erratic=
		0 or 1, emulates wireless mouse low on battery (or maybe a 'in need of cleaning mouse') :D
		This option can be changes by r-click on the window and check the menu (not saved on exit).
